This folder contains tools created to make your (ROM maintainer) life easier :)

incremental.php:
 this file can be executed in terminal by BASH users (like OSX or Linux)
 just make sure to add executive permissions to the files, if needed.
 
 It auto-magically creates an incremental update, starting from an old unzipped (full) update
 to the new unzipped (full) update.
 
 usage: ./incremental.php -o OLD_FULL_ROM_DIR -n NEW_FULL_ROM_DIR -w
  -o: old rom folder
  -n: new rom folder
  -w: if you want to create a folder named "incremental" (remember to delete
      it first if exists) with all the changes in it. Please check its updater-script
      file (META-INF/com/google/android/), it's automatically generated and may
      contain errors or useless code (up to you). If not specified, it will only
      list the removed, new and changed files.
  -h: a list of available arguments
